\section{Project Drivers}

This section will give a general overview of the motivation behind creating Mac-AR, along with what constraints it needs to be created within. 

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
In the modern world, it has become increasingly harder to meet new people and form connections with others. This has become especially true in recent years, with the pandemic isolating people even further. Mac-AR aims to solve this by providing a fun, interactive means to cooperate with others and form new connections. As a team, users will be able to work alongside people either co-located or remotely at places they prefer, to solve interesting puzzles and bond with each other.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
The following groups and individuals are the reason for the existence of Mac-AR. 

\subsubsection{The Client}
Dr Irene Yuan is the sole client for the project, requesting that the tool be made. She will act as the point of contact during development and ensure that the final result is in line with what was envisioned. 

\subsubsection{Hands-on Users of the Application}
The users are the ones who will be using the tool and building connections with others. The main user base is intended to be young adults, roughly ages 18-30, who enjoy games and are moderately comfortable using technology.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
This application will not have a significant impact on those outside of it as the application does not require significant motion from the user or interaction with others not in the game. Warnings will be used in the application to ensure users are aware of their surroundings at all times so as not to disturb others nearby.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
The project will be developed and released within the following constraints. 

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints} \label{SolutionConstraints}
\emph{Description:} The product shall be built as a mobile application.\\
\emph{Rationale:} The supervisor wants the application to be a mobile application, as to ensure the largest freedom to the users for where and how the product will be used.\\
\emph{Fit Criterion:} The product shall be written using Unity engine and be accessible on both Android and iOS application stores.\\

\noindent
\emph{Description:} The product shall be able to function on a variety of mobile devices, using both iOS and Android.\\
\emph{Rationale:} To provide service to the widest array of users, the most popular phone brands, and by extension their operating systems, need to be supported.\\
\emph{Fit Criterion:} The product shall be tested to function on popular mobile devices using iOS and Android, specifically 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Samsung S20 FE 5G
    \item iPhone SE
    \item Motorolla G7 Power
    \item Google Pixel 7
    \item iPhone Special Edition 2020
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
Not applicable as the system is not being built off of an existing solution. 

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
In the current design of the product, there are no partner or collaborative applications that will
work along with the product. Therefore, there are no partner or collaborative constraints.

\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
There is no current solution off of which the system is being built or constraints regarding any such software. 

\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment will be intentionally broad. The product can be used from anywhere the user has access to a mobile device and an internet connection to run the application, with no limits on being indoors. 

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
The general document and development milestone constraints are as follows:
\begin{table}[H]

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent
As a general constraint applied on top of all of these, all work should be done a few days in advance to allow for time to review. 

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The project has no monetary budget. If there are any necessary purchases for development, the cost
shall be paid by the project members and reimbursed by the supervisor. Furthermore, these purchases
may not exceed \$750.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
The project currently has no enterprise constraints.

\end{table}
\begin{itemize}
    \item CG1, CG2, CG3, CG5 are all unlikely to change as they are basic properties/needs of a game room that users are able to join
    \item JG1, JG2, JG4, JG5, are all unlikely to change as capacity updates and scene changes when joining a room will always be necessary features
    \item RS1, RS2, RS3 are all unlikely to change as the capability to edit room settings after creating a room adds convenience to the game that will be useful when performing the study and for casual players of the game
    \item CG4, JG3, RS3 are fairly likely to change as it is not necessary that a game room have a password. It may be decided that this requirement is not needed
    \item ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4 are all unlikely to change as the game start procedure is core to the identity of the game as a multiplayer augmented reality communication-based game
    \item PI1, PI2, PI3, PI4 are all unlikely to change as it is unlikely the game will be modified such that users do not need to be able to interact with their puzzles and see the result of these interactions
    \item HR1, HR2, HR3, SP1, SP2 are all likely to change as hints and skips have been primarily implemented to facilitate the study. If the game changes to become more time-based and competitive these features may change or be removed
    \item SM1, SM2, SM3, SM4, RM1, RM2, RM3, VM1, VM2 are all unlikely to change as they are the core properties of text and voice communication which are fundamental to the game which is based on communication. Requirements may however be added to these sections if these features are expanded upon in the future
    \item All individual puzzle requirements (SS, MP, IP, CP, WP) are likely to changes as the puzzles in the game may be swapped out or heavily modified in the future. The individual puzzles are the most variable part of this game and could easily be changed without altering the identity and purpose of the game
    \item The formal specification is unlikely to change as a room should never exceed its capacity

    \caption{Non-Functional Likely/Unlikely to Change Table}
    \label{tab:my_label2}
\end{table}
\begin{itemize}
    \item LF1 and LF2 are unlikely to change as they are basic visual requirements to make the app usable
    \item UH1, UH2, UH3, UH4, UH5, UH6, UH7 are unlikely to change as they are navigation, environment and network based requirements that are required for reasonable usability of the game
    \item PR1 is likely to change. As game systems improve the maximum response time should be able to be reduced significantly
    \item PR2 is unlikely to change as users should always be notified when the game is not available
    \item OE1 is likely to change as newer devices come out and the system evolves to meet those specifications
    \item MS1 and MS2 are unlikely to change as documentation should always remain up to date to facilitate maintainability
    \item SR1 and SR2 are unlikely to change as user data confidentiality and protection should always remain in place
    \item CR1 is unlikely to change as the game should never contain offensive content
    \item CR2 is likely to change as the game may be expanded to include more languages
    \item LR1 is unlikely to change as the game must remain legally viable

\section{Project Issues}
The following section will go over the current issues for the project. It will describe open issues, current off-the-shelf solutions, new problems, and tasks that need to be worked on.

\subsection{Open Issues}
There are no open issues for this project.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
The following section will go over existing off-the-shelf solutions and reusable components from these solutions.

\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
There are several already made products that have similar aspects to the project however they are missing some key aspects. Examples include ARctic Escape and We Were Here. Similarly to this project, ARctic Escape is an AR game that encourages social interaction. Users must work together to solve puzzles and complete the game ~\citep{ARcticEscape} . The main difference between this project and ARctic Escape is that in ARctic Escape, users must be in the same area/room to play the game, however, Mac-AR is based around users being able to interact and play the game remotely. Continuing on, We Were Here is a two player game in which users must work together to solve difficult puzzles. The game can be played remotely between the two players and there is an in-game communication system that allows the users to talk to each other. We Were Here, however, does not have any AR component to it, which is one of the main aspects of this project.

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
Plenty of libraries and other frameworks that already exist can be used in the project. AR Foundation is one such framework that can be used through Unity. It supports features such as device tracking and 2D image tracking which can be used for tracking the movement of users phones while playing the game. Additionally, there are the Zed-Rig plugins that Unity supports. These can help provide functionality for AR object placement as well as spatial mapping. Continuing on, ARctic Escape which was mentioned in the Ready-Made Products, was able to have spatial mapping through a Snapchat Lens. This allowed for users to record their surroundings and have the room they were in mapped and able to be used in the AR environment.

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
Currently, the only known product that is similar to this project and can be copied without copyright issues is ARctic Escape, however, this game is implemented much differently than the plan for this project. ARctic Escape was implemented as a Snapchat Lens, however, the goal for this project is to create a standalone application through the Unity framework.

\subsection{New Problems}
The following section will describe potential problems of the application's creation. It will go over the effects on the current environment and installed system, as well as user problems and other follow-up problems.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The application will affect the way people who are isolated/remote are able to connect with others. It will provide them with a way to interact in a more physical way than traditional video games. The study for which the application is being used will also provide valuable insight into how people interact remotely using AR tools, helping to find good principles for future games. As mentioned previously, there will not be a significant impact on those not using the application due to the minimal space requirements of the game and the warnings to be aware of ones surroundings.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
The application will not have any effect on the mobile devices it is installed on. It will act as a standalone application on the device and should not affect any other parts of the device.

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
A potential user problem may be the difficulty in solving in-game puzzles/tasks. If tasks are too difficult to complete, it may result in users wanting to quit the game, and therefore resulting in a decreased level of social interaction. Additionally, if the tasks are too easy to solve, this may also reduce the level of social interaction as users will not need to communicate as much. This may also result in users not enjoying the play.

\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
It is assumed that users will be able to use the application in an area with internet connection, however, it is not unusual that people may have Internet issues, which may cause them to lose connection to the Internet. This results in a problem as without Internet connection users will disconnect from the host server, causing them to not be able to play the game or interact with their partner.

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}
Other problems include if libraries used in the creation of the application get updated while the project is ongoing. This may result in certain in-game functionality not behaving as intended. Another problem that may arise is if users are able to find ways to solve tasks by themselves, without the need for interaction with others. The main purpose of the application is to have social interaction between users, and this would result in users not needing to communicate with each other.

\subsection{Tasks}
The following section will go over the planning of the project.

\subsubsection{Project Planning}
The project schedule will follow the deadline for the deliverables outlined in the SFWRENG 4G06
course outline.

\subsubsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
The development of the project will be split into three phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Creation of a proof of concept and documentation
    \item Initial development of the application with consideration to PoC
    \item Refinement of application and documentation after user feedback
\end{itemize}
The creation of the proof of concept demonstration will aid in overcoming the main challenges of the system. It will demonstrate the ability for multiple users to interact in AR, and provide the documentation for the future application to be developed.

The initial development of the application will take the design of the PoC and improve on the concepts. Four puzzles will be implemented, and the multiplayer functionalities will also be implemented. The Save/Load game functional requirements and the hint and skip system will not be required for revision 0 as they are not crucial parts of the overall system. The stakeholders will be able to see the implementation and provide feedback. 

The refinement will take all the user feedback and improve on the initial design. There is no expectation for major features to be developed at this stage, just improvements on the existing system and the addition of potential stretch goals.

High priority requirements make up the core components of the game, without which the game would not be playable. These are also requirements the development team was most concerned about implementing for the proof of concept.

Medium priority requirements are game mechanics that create the structure of the game and make it fun to play by creating the flow of the game and adding puzzle variability.

Low priority requirements are add-ons that contribute to ease-of-use of the game and quality of life. They're not strictly necessary, hence the lowest priority.

\subsection{Risks}
The main risks of the project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users losing awareness of their surroundings and potentially getting injured
    \item Server overload could cause lag in gameplay, resulting in an unpleasant user experience
    \item Potential data loss if the server storing saved game data malfunctions/breaks
    \item Failure to meet deadlines will cause setbacks for the project. In the event of this, some requirements might not be met, and documents will have to be modified to reflect this. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}
There is no financial costs associated with the development of the application, and there is no cost for users downloading and using the application. Furthermore, the time to development time is estimated to be six months, with work being divided amongst four developers.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
The following section will go over any training and documentation that is needed for users, as well as waiting room ideas and ideas for implementation
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
The users will have a user help document available to them within the application in the form of a gameplay menu. It will contain information on how to use the application, as well as any instructions regarding interacting with puzzles/tasks.

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
The users will have a ``tutorial" when they first start the game that will teach them how to use the application. It will show the users how to use AR technology, and give them a simple puzzle to solve.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
There are currently no requirements or functionalities that are not being included in the initial release. Future ones may be added later on.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
During the requirements and idea generation phases, additional ideas were generated on how to implement the solution.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Form
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Since the application will be developed using Unity framework, the idea of using Unity based libraries and plugins for AR framework such as AR Foundation and Zed-Rig.
    \end{itemize}

% \noindent \plt{Advice on using the template:
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item Difference between physical and software constraints
% 		\item Properties of a correct solution means \emph{additional} properties, not a restating of the
% 		      requirements (may be ``not applicable'' for your problem). If you have a table of output
% 		      constraints, then these are properties of a correct solution.
% 		\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
% 		\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
% 		\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of reference by fields as
% 		      automatically generatable
% 		\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your requirement could be more abstract

\section{Appendix}
This section will be used to capture miscellaneous information that couldn't easily be fit into the rest of the document.  

\subsection{Reflection}

% \plt{The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the graduate attribute
% of Lifelong Learning. Please answer the following questions:}

% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item \plt{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete this
% 	      capstone project? Examples of possible knowledge to acquire include domain specific knowledge from
% 	      the domain of your application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
% 	      computer science knowledge. Skills may be related to technology, or writing, or presentation, or
% 	      team management, etc. You should look to identify at least one item for each team member.}

% 	\item \plt{For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least
% 	      two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill? Of the identified approaches,
% 	      which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}

% \end{enumerate}

A new and unique set of skills will be required for the completion of this project. It is hoped that the entire team will have an exposure to everything listed below, but the team members in charge of fostering the skill and development of the sections that require it are also listed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item [RS1]\textbf{Mobile App Development}: Developing a mobile application presents unique challenges that aren't present when developing a standard computer application. Dealing with limited memory and processing power, navigating the licensing and system requirements for different devices, and fully utilizing the tools embedded in phones are all skills that will need to be developed over the course of the project. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main Team Members}: Sam, Matthew
    \end{itemize}
    \item [RS2]\textbf{Augmented Reality}: Integrating AR into an application requires an understanding of how to get a piece of software to integrate with the real world. Team members will need to learn how to make the tool process the readings from various video and location instruments, calculate how to place objects into a 3D space, and give the user the tools to manipulate the world through their augmented view. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main Team Members}: Kieran, Ethan, Sam, Matthew
    \end{itemize}
    \item [RS3]\textbf{Communication Services}: Allowing different devices, running on different types of software to communicate with each other over long distances is a vital part of capturing the collaborative aspect of the project. The team will need to investigate how to accomplish this networking. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main Team Members}: Kieran, Matthew
    \end{itemize}
    \item [RS4]\textbf{Location Services}: Tracking the location of the user and integrating nearby landmarks in real time adds additional depth to the tool. A vital skill will be getting the tool to interface with existing location services. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main Team Members}: Ethan, Sam
    \end{itemize}
    \item [RS5]\textbf{Game Design}: Getting a large and diverse user base is essential for the collaborative aspect of the tool. Researching what makes a game fun to play and striking a balance between the difficulty and complexity of the puzzles is what will drive this engagement. We will acquire these skills via the unity forums and various unity tutorials found on YouTube. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main Team Members}: Kieran, Ethan
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

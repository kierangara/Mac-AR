\section{Introduction}

%\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

In order to make an application that is usable and safe for users, common hazards need to be thought about beforehand and ways for mitigating them need to be developed. A hazard is anything that fails or modifies the intended functionalities of the Mac AR application, as well as anything that could pose a danger to the user or cause system failure. Hazards originate from a variety of sources such as issues with third-part dependencies, environmental conditions, and unstable user connection to the application. 

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The purpose of the hazard analysis is to document potential hazards that may arise when the application is being used and find ways to prevent or mitigate them. The scope of the hazard analysis will involve outlining the system boundaries and components, and potential hazards related to the system itself as well as user interaction with the system. Additionally, it will include the mitigation methods that will be implemented to prevent these potential hazards along with the safety and security requirements that relate to each hazard. Accounting for every single combination of user hardware is not be possible, so the analysis will be generalized for all mobile devices that are able to properly run our intended product.

%The purpose of the hazard analysis is to think about all potential hazards within the bounds of the software and hardware used, how hazard mitigation is to be implemented, and the safety and security requirements associated with these hazards. The scope of the document will include but be not limited to: potential hazards with the environment for users, potential hazards with the application itself, and mitigation methods within the application to prevent potential hazards. Accounting for every single combination of user hardware should not be possible, so the analysis will be generalized for all mobile devices that are able to properly run our intended product. 

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

The system will be divided into the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The frontend and backend parts of the system:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Backend server
        \item User interface
    \end{itemize}
    \item Physical Device:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Smartphone
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The backend server will be responsible for connecting users together in a room, and associating puzzles with the users. The user interface is responsible for providing the user with an interact-able game, and handling all the user's inputs. The physical device that the user will run the application on is a Smartphone.

\section{Critical Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users will not intentionally try to injure themselves or others while using the application
    \item Users will respect warning messages related to proper use of the application
\end{itemize}

%\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
%minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
%you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
%this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}
The Failure Mode and Effect Analysis table breaks down the potential hazards/failures of the application, along with their effects and the causes leading to the failure. Additionally, each hazard has a recommended action that describes how the hazard will be mitigated, along with the specific safety and security requirements it relates to. The specific hazards also have a severity associated with them (low, medium, or high).

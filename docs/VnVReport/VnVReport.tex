\section{Changes Due to Testing}
Currently, our group has done one usability testing session, however, there are plans to do more in the future. As a result, we will most likely receive more feedback and make changes based on this. 

\begin{table}[H]
\resizebox{5.5in}{!}{\begin{tabular}{|p{0.135\linewidth}|p{0.5\linewidth}|p{0.6\linewidth}|}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\bfseries Source} & \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\bfseries Feedback} & \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\bfseries Changes} \\
\hline
Usability Testing & Time to play the game is $<$30 minutes & Our group has decided to remove the Save/Load game requirements after usability testing, as the game only takes 15-30 minutes to complete, and doesn't really need a save game option.  \\
\hline
Usability Testing & Time to play the game is $<$30 minutes & Since game length is max 30 minutes, our group has decided to have only 5 puzzles since this will keep the game within the time limit \\
\hline
Usability Survey and TA meeting& Calibration step not necessary & Removed FR-ST3 since there is no need for a calibration setup step for our technology to be used.\\
\hline
Usability Testing & Difficulty creating lobby as no notification was given for password not meeting requirements& Added pop-up notifications to give information to users (such as if password is not long enough)\\
\hline
Usability Testing & Join lobby button had issues as when pressed multiple times consecutively, users were unable to join the game room & Disabled join lobby button once it has been pressed to prevent consecutive server calls\\
\hline
Dr. Yuan Feedback & Isometric Puzzle spawns too high, resulting in users being unable to see letter/number on top of the puzzle & Instantiation of the Isometric Puzzle prefab adjusted to spawn in a lower position, and size of puzzle decreased\\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

\section{Automated Testing}
The automated test suite is, due to limitations with Unity, split into two parts. Both parts, the Edit Mode and Play Mode test suites, utilize NUnit to create and run the tests.

The Play Mode tests use Unity's InputSystem library to simulate user inputs (clicks, rotations, etc.), and consist of the majority of tests that simulate user interaction or multiplayer aspects.

The Edit Mode tests are more basic unit tests that test individual script functions. These tests are run on the CI/CD pipeline. In addition to the tests that the Mac-AR team has created, certain unity packages come with built in unit tests that are run alongside this suite. These additional tests currently number 682 in total.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}
Our project did not have any strict requirements on meeting a particular code coverage percentage. Furthermore, lots of manual testing was done due to the use of the Unity framework.

\textbf{Module} & \textbf{Branch Coverage} & \textbf{Line Coverage} \\ \hline
     Multiplayer Puzzle           &     11\%                     &     33\%                   \\ \hline
        Wires        &       45\%                   &            63\%            \\ \hline

\section{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}

The main difference between the original plan and how the validation and verification was conducted was the amount of tests that we thought we could automate. All of the members of the teams are very familiar with unit testing and therefore a large part of the VnV plan revolved around creating a comprehensive testing suite that could be run before every new feature to ensure correctness. What we failed to account for was the how strict Unity's environment was, and therefore how much work would have to be shifted to manual verification. This was fully a product of our inexperience with the program, and on future projects it is likely that we would be able to create a more accurate plan from the start.

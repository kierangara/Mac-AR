**The project:**  
This project is our McMaster University Software Engineering Capstone Project. We are building an Augmented Reality (AR) escape room style game, which involves collaborating with teamates to complete a series of AR based puzzles. The goal of this project is to observe social interactions between players collaborating from different physical locations on the same AR game.  

The game is developed in Unity and uses the Vivox voice and text chat system to enable remote communication.
